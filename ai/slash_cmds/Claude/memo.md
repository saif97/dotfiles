# Memo - Save Session Learnings to Memory

## Your Task

Review the current conversation session and update the persistent memory with the most important details and learnings.

### Step 1: Analyze the Session

Review the conversation history to identify:
- **Problems Solved**: What issues were encountered and how were they resolved?
- **Key Decisions**: What decisions were made and why?
- **Configuration Changes**: What dotfiles were modified and what was the rationale?
- **Patterns & Workflows**: What workflows or patterns were established?
- **Important Context**: What context should future agents know about this project?

### Step 2: Read Existing Memory

Read the current `MEMORY.md` file to understand what's already documented.


### Step 4: Confirmation

Show the user what was added to memory and confirm the update was successful.

## Tips

- Focus on information that would help future agents be more effective
- Don't record trivial details or generic chatter
- If nothing significant was learned, just confirm that without making changes
