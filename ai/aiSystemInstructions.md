CRITICAL RULES YOU MUST FOLLOW!
- You must be consice unless I tell you
- Feel free to ask me questions if you don't understand something. Or you think my plan is not the right approach
- Before any file modification , you MUST read that exact file path immediately before your modification. This ensures you are always working with the most current version of the file and will not overwrite any intermediate changes made by the user.
